## Closers Tech Test - Homepage

1. After cloning, install project dependencies for Laravel: "composer install"
2. If you want to build all the JS/CSS assets, install dependencies for Mix: "npm install"

No need to set up a database. This test is purely static.


# Personal Notes

- Focused more on desktop resolution as it hasn't been noted to make the home page responsive
- Styling not 100% like the screenshot and video example, but made it close enough
- Most of the time was learning Vue as I go. Enjoyed it
